### 1. How does Next.JS differ from a traditional React application?

Next.js and traditional React applications both use React as their core library for building user interfaces. A traditional React application focuses solely on building user interfaces with React components, while Next.js is a framework built on top of React that adds features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), built-in routing, automatic code splitting, and optimized data fetching, making it ideal for building full-fledged web applications with improved performance and SEO capabilities, wheres a basic React app requires additional libraries to implement these functionalities.

### 2. What are the advantages of using Next.js for server-side rendering?

Using Next.js server-side rendering offers several advantages like improved performance, better SEO (Search Engine Optimization) due to fully rendered HTML pages on the server, a smoother user experience with faster initial load times, easy development with built-in features, and efficient caching mechanisms, making it ideal for content-heavy websites like blogs and e-commerce platforms.

### 3. Explain the difference between SSR and SSG

SSR (Server-side rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation) are two methods for generating web pages in a Next.js application. SSR generates a page on the server for each user request, while SSG pre-renders all pages at build time., creating HTML files that are served directly to the client, resulting in significantly faster loading times but limiting the ability to dynamically update content on the page.

### 4. What is the `getStaticProps` function in Next.js?

The getStaticProps is an async function that we export from the page component, used to generate data on the build time. It fetches the data and generates the HTML pages on our server and it caches it. So when we navigate to this page on our client side, the cached HTML page is served directly to us, which is very useful for search engine optimization (SEO).

### 5. What is the `getServerSideProps` function in Next.js?

The getServerSideProps function in Next.js is used for Server-side Rendering (SSR). As a result, itâ€™s particularly useful for sites with dynamic data or requests that must be made often, allowing us to render a page with the most up-to-date data.

### 6. What is the purpose of the next.config.js file?

The next.config.js file in Next.js is a configuration file that allows us to customize various aspects of how our Next.js application behaves. It provides a way to set up advanced features, adjust build settings, and configure options for both development and production environments.
The file enables settings like:

- Environment variables
- Redirects
- Rewrites
- Image Optimization
- Headers
- Locale Settings

### 7. What are some common performance optimization techniques in Next.js?

Next.js provides several inbuilt optimizations that we can use to improve the build performance of our application, such as

- Static Site Generation (SSG) with `getStaticProps`
- Server-side Rendering (SSR) with `getServerSideProps`
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Code Splitting
- Image Optimization
- Font Optimization
- Lazy loading components
- Prefetching, as well as
- Optimizing third-party scripts.

### 8. Explain how middleware works in Next.js.

Middleware in Next.js is a powerful mechanism that is used to perform tasks before rendering a page. It allows us to intercept requests before they reach the page component. It enables us to perform operations like authentication, authorization, redirects, logging, data fetching, and modifying the request and response objects.

Middleware functions are executed before the request reaches the final route handler. They can be used to intercept and modify requests and responses. Middleware is defined in the `middleware.js` file at the root of our project.

### 9. What is prefetching in Next.js?

Prefetching in Next.js is the process of preloading linked page resources before the user navigates to them. This improves the performance and user experience by reducing the time it takes to load a page when the user clicks a link.

Next.js automatically prefetches the linked pages in the background when it detects that a link is in the viewport (visible area of the browser). This is done using the `<Link/>` component.

### 10. How can you handle client-side navigation in Next.js?

In Next.js client-side navigation means navigation between pages without a full page reload. Next.js provides several features to enable client-side navigation efficiently and seamlessly.

- Using the Link component
- Programmatic Navigation with `useRouter`
